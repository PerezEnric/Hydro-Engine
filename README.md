### Camera

* W/A/S/D  + Left Click to move the camera (hold left shift to move faster)
* Alt + Right Click to rotate the camera

### Vehicle

* Arrows to move

### Others

* F1 to show debug draw from physics

## Things to know

 - When you open the engine it will load a street scene. It will take a little time to load all game objects.

 - If you want to see quadtrees, you should go: view -> camera settings

 - To create a constraint: Create->Constraint

 - Vehicle can only be used while in-game
